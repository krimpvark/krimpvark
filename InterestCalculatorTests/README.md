## What are we doing here?

Testing the built-in Visual Studio unit test generator with MSTest

## How?

Right-click > add unit tests

## What results do we get?

Pros

- built into vs
- easy to set up
- good for scaffolding

Cons

- only picks up existing test project on add
- generates one test per method
+ if you want to, for example, test null inputs then you need to add a separate fn
+ naming is very generic

Overall

- good for building up some momentum, but not great for useful tests
